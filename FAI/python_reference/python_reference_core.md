# Python Reference Core - [KNOW] and [HEARD] Content

## **[PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING FOCUS]**
This reference emphasizes procedural programming. Use simple variable assignments, function calls, and sequential logic. Avoid suggesting class-based solutions or advanced OOP patterns.

---

# Object Oriented Programming [HEARD]

**What students should understand:** Python uses objects, but we focus on procedural programming. Students encounter OOP terms in online resources but should use procedural approaches.

**Key Terms:**
- **Objects** - Everything in Python (variables, functions, data)
- **Methods** - Functions that belong to objects (e.g., `list.append()`)
- **Attributes** - Properties of objects
- **Constructors** - Ways to create objects

**Our Approach:** Use built-in functions and simple variable assignments rather than creating custom classes.

# Basic Python Scripts [KNOW]

## Script Structure
```python
# 1. Imports
import math

# 2. Function definitions  
def calculate_tuition(credits):
    return credits * 1500

# 3. Main code
student_credits = 15
tuition = calculate_tuition(student_credits)
print(f"Tuition: ${tuition}")
```

## Comments [KNOW]
```python
# Single line comment
"""
Multi-line comment
for longer explanations
"""
```

## Import Statements [KNOW]
```python
import math                    # Import entire module
from math import sqrt          # Import specific function
from math import ceil as round_up  # Import with alias
```

## Indentation [KNOW]
Python uses indentation (4 spaces) to define code blocks:
```python
if credits > 12:
    print("Full-time student")    # Must be indented
    tuition = credits * 1500      # Same indentation level
```

---

# Variables [KNOW]

## Basic Assignment
```python
student_name = "Alex"          # String
credits = 15                   # Integer  
gpa = 3.75                     # Float
enrolled = True                # Boolean
```

## Naming Conventions [KNOW]
- Use descriptive names: `student_grade` not `sg`
- Use snake_case: `first_name` not `firstName`
- Start with letter or underscore
- Case-sensitive: `Name` â‰  `name`

## Lists [KNOW]
```python
grades = [88, 92, 85, 90]      # Ordered, changeable, allows duplicates
grades.append(87)              # Add item
print(len(grades))             # Get length
```

## Tuples [HEARD] 
```python
departments = ("ENGR", "MATH", "COMP")  # Ordered, unchangeable
# departments[0] = "PHYS"  # This would cause an error
```

## Sets [HEARD]
```python
majors = {"Engineering", "Math", "CS"}  # Unordered, unique values only
print(majors)  # Duplicates automatically removed
```
