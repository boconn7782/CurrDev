# Python Coverage Index - Master Reference

## Coverage Level Definitions

- **[KNOW]** - Students will know: Category covered, emphasized, and held accountable in quizzes/assignments
- **[HEARD]** - Students will have heard: Introduced but not functionally applied, for recognition only
- **[MAYBE]** - Students may know: Covered in some sections or pursued independently in projects  
- **[NC]** - Not covered: Too advanced, beyond curriculum scope

## **[PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING FOCUS]**
All Python instruction emphasizes procedural programming paradigms. Avoid object-oriented patterns, class-based solutions, or advanced OOP concepts unless specifically noted.

## **GAPS REQUIRING COMPLETION:**

1. **Missing Examples** - Several sections in original doc lack complete examples
2. **MicroPython Content** - Substantial content marked "in development"
3. **Advanced Topics** - Some [MAYBE] items need full explanations
4. **Cross-References** - Links between concepts need mapping
5. **Common Use Cases** - Many sections need practical applications added
