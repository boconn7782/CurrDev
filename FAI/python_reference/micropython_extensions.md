# MicroPython Extensions - Hardware Programming

**Note:** MicroPython shares most syntax with standard Python but adds hardware-specific capabilities for microcontroller programming.

---

# MicroPython = Python + Hardware [KNOW]

## Shared Syntax and Concepts
All these work the same in MicroPython:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and basic operations
- Lists, strings, and basic data structures
- Import statements
- Comments and basic script structure

## Key Differences from Standard Python
1. **Hardware interaction** through machine library
2. **Continuous execution** model (like Arduino)
3. **Memory constraints** - more limited than desktop Python
4. **Real-time requirements** for hardware control

# Arduino-Style Programming Structure [KNOW]

## Setup() and Loop() Equivalent
Unlike Arduino, MicroPython doesn't have built-in setup() and loop() functions. Create this pattern manually:

```python
# MicroPython continuous execution pattern
from machine import Pin
import time

# Setup section (runs once)
led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)    # Built-in LED on Pico
button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)

# Main loop (runs continuously)
while True:
    if button.value():
        led.toggle()
        time.sleep(0.5)   # Debounce delay
```

**Comparison with Arduino:**
```cpp
// Arduino equivalent
void setup() {
  pinMode(25, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(14, INPUT_PULLDOWN);
}

void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(14)) {
    digitalWrite(25, !digitalRead(25));
    delay(500);
  }
}
```

# Machine Library [KNOW]

## Digital I/O with Pin Objects [KNOW]

### Creating Pin Objects
```python
from machine import Pin

# Output pin (LED)
led = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)

# Input pin with pull-down resistor
button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)

# Input pin with pull-up resistor  
switch = Pin(16, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
```

### Digital Operations [KNOW]
```python
# Writing to outputs
led.on()           # Set pin HIGH (3.3V)
led.off()          # Set pin LOW (0V)  
led.toggle()       # Switch between HIGH/LOW
led.value(1)       # Set to HIGH
led.value(0)       # Set to LOW

# Reading from inputs
button_state = button.value()    # Returns 1 or 0
if button.value():
    print("Button pressed")
```

### Complete Digital I/O Example
```python
from machine import Pin
import time

# Setup
led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)                    # Onboard LED
external_led = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)           # External LED
button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)   # Button input

# Main loop
while True:
    if button.value():
        led.on()
        external_led.toggle()
        time.sleep(0.2)
    else:
        led.off()

# ... do something ...
elapsed = time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_ms(), start_time)
print(f"Elapsed: {elapsed}ms")
```

maximum = builtins.max(numbers)
